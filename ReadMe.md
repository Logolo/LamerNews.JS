This is clone of [lamer news](http://lamernews.com/) written in Node.JS with Jade & Stylus for templates.

To set this up -

*  do a `npm install -l` to get the dependecies
*  copy config.js.example to config.js & fill it up with oauth key/secrets & redis connection info.

PS: this is a work in progress
